### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸŒ± My current research interest lies in the field of time series anomaly detection, with a particular focus on its applications within the semiconductor industry.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently pursuing my studies at the IMLab (Information Management Laboratory) within the Department of Industrial Engineering at Seoul National University.
- ðŸ”­ For approximately two and a half years, I had the privilege of working at RTM (Rocket To the Moon), focusing on research and product development in anomaly detection and fault detection for dry strip equipment.
